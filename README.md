====
* add support for Unisphere <8.0.1
* investigate additional query options, replication, capacity, performance, etc.
* duplicate some reporting that happens now for performance and configuration analysis
* incorporate FAST Pool subscription reports per http://www.scottbrightwell.org/2013/11/21/some-emc-vmax-storage-reporting-formulas/
